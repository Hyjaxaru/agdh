# PlaceholderGame

I've been through the course already,
so i've already made a game in :simple-gamemaker: GameMaker Studio.

It's called Placeholder (yes, that's actually the name),
and it's a fun little rouge-like shooter.

It's by no means perfect, and kinda un-optimised, but it *works*

Now where did I leave the code...

    The design and theory behind my game. You can tell im not a designer...

-   :material-code-tags:{ .lg .middle } **Development**

    ---
    The tech behind the game. unoptimised code that's over-complicated.
