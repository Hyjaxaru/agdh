# A Game Designer's Handbook

![Image title](assets/hero_transparent.png){ width="auto" }

***HEY!*** ðŸ‘‹

!!! note inline end
    This handbook (at least for now) is for the development side of the course,
    not the theory.

If you're reading this, you likely picked "L6 Game Design" as one of your subject choices. If so, then that's awesome!

Arguably it's the best class in the whole school.
I mean, you spend the year making and playing games!
What's not to love?
Just remember to take it seriously...

That being said, this handbook should contain many of the things you need to know to get started in making games, specifically in :simple-gamemaker: GameMaker Studio.
